# MITx-6.00.1x
MITx 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

### This is an online course from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on Introduction of Computer Science on Edx for Summer 2021. This repo contains all the basic ideas related to Computer Science using Python my favourite programming language. This course is about ability to think computationally and solved complex problems using different algorithms meanwhile introducing basic foundation to CS.


## 6.00.1x Syllabus
Welcome to 6.00.1x! In this course you’ll be learning the basics of computer
programming in Python and the fundamentals of computation, as well as getting the
opportunity to implement your own Python functions.

This course is offered online and we understand that there are many opportunities
available to cheat. We caution you to not do so. You will learn less and only harm
yourself by cheating. We ask that you review our collaboration and forum guidelines,
available on the course handouts page, to understand how we expect our students to
conduct themselves in this course. Additionally, all students are expected to follow the
edX Honor Code, available at [edx](https://www.edx.org/honor).

If you have a disability-related request regarding accessing an assignment or the final
exam, please contact the edX Help [Center](https://courses.edx.org/support/contact_us)
as early in the course as possible or at least 2 weeks prior to exam start date to allow
time to respond in advance of course deadlines. Requests are reviewed via an
interactive process to meet accessibility requirements for learners with disabilities and
uphold the academic integrity for MITx.
