# 6.00.1x Syllabus
Welcome to 6.00.1x! In this course you’ll be learning the basics of computer
programming in Python and the fundamentals of computation, as well as getting the
opportunity to implement your own Python functions.

This course is offered online and we understand that there are many opportunities
available to cheat. We caution you to not do so. You will learn less and only harm
yourself by cheating. We ask that you review our collaboration and forum guidelines,
available on the course handouts page, to understand how we expect our students to
conduct themselves in this course. Additionally, all students are expected to follow the
edX Honor Code, available at [edx](https://www.edx.org/honor).

If you have a disability-related request regarding accessing an assignment or the final
exam, please contact the edX Help [Center](https://courses.edx.org/support/contact_us)
as early in the course as possible or at least 2 weeks prior to exam start date to allow
time to respond in advance of course deadlines. Requests are reviewed via an
interactive process to meet accessibility requirements for learners with disabilities and
uphold the academic integrity for MITx.

## Lecture 14 – Summary



##  Exercises and Exams
All course material will be released at 14:00 UTC. Finger exercises have no due date, but
we encourage students to complete them as they view the lectures. See the Calendar
tab for Problem Set due dates. Regrettably, extensions are unavailable for any
assignment but your lowest problem set score is dropped.

All problem sets will be due at 23:30 or 11:30 pm UTC. This is the Coordinated Universal
Time, also known as the Greenwich Mean Time. Convert to your local time zone using
an online converter such as this [one:](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html)
Exams are scheduled in advance. The exams will take place online, on the course
website. Exams are timed – once you begin during the exam period, you will have 8
hours to complete it.
- The Midterm will take place from July 2 (14:00 UTC) to July 6 (23:30 UTC).
- The Final Exam will take place from July 30 (14:00 UTC) to Aug 3 (23:30 UTC)

During the exam period, the forums will be shut down. You will still be able to read
posts but you will not be able to post any questions. The honor code prohibits students
from communicating with one another during the exam period in any way whatsoever –
so please don’t discuss the exam on any other forum, website or in person with anyone
else. 


## Grading Policy
In this course there will be many types of assignments. Your final grade will be a
weighted average of the following:
- Finger exercises (available within each lecture video sequence) – 10%
- Problem sets – 40%
- Midterm – 25%
- Final exam – 25%
